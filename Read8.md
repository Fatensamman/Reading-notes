## Comparison & Logical Operators

- Conditional statements make it easier to make choices on what to do next with your code. 
- To compare two operands, the comparison operators (===, !==, ==, !=, <, >, <=, =>) are used. 
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of operators for comparison. 
- If, else   statements allow you to run one code set if a condition is true and another if it is false.

- It is possible to coerze data types from one type to another. 
- All principles are evaluated to be either true or false. 
- Three forms of loop are available: for, while, and do... Uh, while. Each one repeats a series of statements.
