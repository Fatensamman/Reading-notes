## DATABASE NORMALIZATION

- Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The progression from unruly to optimized passes through several normal forms. There are three normal forms most databases adhere to using. As tables satisfy each successive database normalization form, they become less prone to database modification anomalies and more focused toward a sole purpose or topic. 

### Reasons for Database Normalization
- There are three main reasons to normalize a database. The first is to minimize duplicate data, the second is to avoid or avoid data modification issues, and the third is to simplify queries. We'll discuss how each form addresses these issues, but to start, let's look at some data which hasn't been normalized.
