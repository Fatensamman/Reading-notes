# Readings: MUSTACHE and FLEXBOX

## Templating with Mustache:
* Mustache is a syntax without a logic prototype. You can use HTML, settings, references — everything. It can be found. The framework uses meaning in a haze or object to extend tags in a prototype.
It's also called 'logic-less' because no sentences, other clauses, or loops occur. Rather, only tags are visible. A number of symbols, some zero and some a number of values are replaced with a value.
Mustache.js is an execution of the JavaScript moustache template framework. The foundation for JavaScript templating is often considered. Sinc we need a different templating method on the server side, since Mustache supports a variety of languages.

## A Guide to Flexbox:
### What is Flexbox?
In addition to the CSS modes, CSS3 provides another layout mode Flexible Box, commonly called as Flexbox.

Using this mode, you can easily create layouts for complex applications and web pages. Unlike floats, Flexbox layout gives complete control over the direction, alignment, order, size of the boxes.

### Features of Flexbox
Following are the notable features of Flexbox layout −

* Direction − You can arrange the items on a web page in any direction such as left to right, right to left, top to bottom, and bottom to top.

* Order − Using Flexbox, you can rearrange the order of the contents of a web page.

* Wrap − In case of inconsistent space for the contents of a web page (in single line), you can wrap them to multiple lines (both horizontally) and vertically.

* Alignment − Using Flexbox, you can align the contents of the webpage with respect to their container.

* Resize − Using Flexbox, you can increase or decrease the size of the items in the page to fit in available space.
