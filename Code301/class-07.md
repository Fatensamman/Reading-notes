## Readings: REST
- A RESTful API is an Application Program Interface Architectural Style (API) which uses HTTP data access to use applications. This data can also be used to read, edit, create, and delete resource-related operations in GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data forms.

An API for a web is a code that permits the correspondence between two software programs. The API defines the correct way a developer should write a service from an operating system or other device that needs a program.
