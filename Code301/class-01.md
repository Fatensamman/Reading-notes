# RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN and FLOATS

## RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN:

Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web creation that adjusts the layout of a website dynamically based on the screen size and the orientation of the computer it uses. RWD is one solution for the issue of design, from small phones to large desktop displays, for the number of products available to consumers.


The RWD uses so-called interruption points to decide how a site's architecture appears: a design is used above an interruption point and a design below the interruption point. The disturbance points are typically based on the browser distance.

- The same HTML is served to all devices, using CSS (which determines the layout of webpage) to change the appearance of the page. In responsive design, page elements reshuffle as the viewport grows or shrinks. Decisions about hiding content and functionality should be based on knowledge about your users and their needs. It is also possible to hide certain items, such as background images, as in the Transport for London example.

- Smart content prioritization is one key aspect to doing responsive design well. Much more content is visible without scrolling on a large desktop monitor than on a small smartphone screen. Performance can also be an issue with responsive design. A smartphone user does not have an equivalent experience to a desktop user if download times are intolerable. To truly assess the user experience of a responsive design, test your site's performance in varied conditions.      To see the original article oncom, click here.

## CSS Float:
- The CSS float property added to page items on the Internet is much like the pictures in the written style in which the text floats around them. Floating components exist in the web page's flow. This varies markedly from page elements of absolute placement. The page elements which have been completely arranged are omitted from the webpage flow, as if the print layout text box was said to avoid the wrap of the page. Fully placed page elements will not influence other elements' location, and other elements, whether or not they strike one another, do not affect them.
