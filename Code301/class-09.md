## FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
- Functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building computer programs structure and elements, that treats computation to evaluate mathematical functions and prevents change of state and mutable data.

### Pure functions:
* It returns the same result if given the same arguments
* It does not cause any observable side effects.

Pure consistency is reliability, coherence and predictability. With the same configurations, the same results are often returned by pure functions. We should not care of cases that have opposite outcomes with the same parameter — so it will never happen.

### Refactoring
* When should you consider software refactoring?
The best time to consider refactoring is before adding any updates or new features to existing code. Going back and cleaning up the current code before adding in new programming will not only improve the quality of the product itself, it will make it easier for future developers to build on the original code.

* Another time to think about refactoring is right after you’ve delivered a product to market. Yes, that sounds ridiculous. You’ve finally launched a product you’ve been working on for months, maybe even years, and now you have to go back to the beginning? This is actually the perfect time to do a little housekeeping, as chances are developers now have more availability to work on refactoring before moving on to the next job.
