- The Advantages of Node.js:
The benefit of JavaScript on a web server, as well as the browser, aside from speed and scalability, is that your brain doesn't have to change any more modes. You can do it all in the same language that makes you more effective as a developer (and hopefully, happier). For eg, between the server and the client you can easily exchange code.

One of the major benefits of Node is that JSON is voiced. JSON is perhaps the most popular Web data sharing medium for communicating with object databases and lingua franca (such as MongoDB). JSON's perfect for a JavaScript framework, which means while you work with Node,Without the need for reformatting, data can flow well between layers. From window to folder, you should provide one syntax to database.

- Other Uses of Node:
 There are many other exciting and varied uses of Node.js!

For example it can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC. It can also be used to write your own command line tool, such as this Yeoman-Style generator to scaffold out new projects.

Node.js can also can be used to build cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots.
