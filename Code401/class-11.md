## Event-Driven Applications 

- Why is access control important?

Access management is important because it is a useful protection tool for limiting who or what can see or use a given resource.

- Describe an application that would need access control.

This may mean who has access to and edits a specific file, what equipment should be used, or who has access to specific devices in an I.T security environment.

- What is a role used for?

Role Manager is an enterprise role management system that facilitates the management of business and interpersonal relationships, responsibilities, and rights by providing role lifecycle management capability.

- Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Any person in an enterprise is assigned a task-based access control role, which decides the permissions the device gives the individual. You may, for example, appoint a user as an administrator, a consultant, or an end-user, and restrict access to those services or activities. Any employees may be allowed to build or edit files, while others may only be allowed to open them.

 ## Term:

* Authorization:

Authorization is a protection method for determining user/client rights and access levels to device resources such as directories, facilities, computer programs, data, and application features. The method of authorizing or refusing access to a network resource depending on the user's identity allows the user to access a variety of services.

* Role Based Access Control

RBAC (role-based access control) is a policy-independent access-control system based on responsibilities and privileges. RBAC components such as role-permissions, user-roles, and role-role relationships make user assignments easy. RBAC meets multiple needs of commercial and government agencies, according to a NIST report. (5) In wide organisations with hundreds of users and thousands of approvals, RBAC can be used to make security management easier. Despite the fact that RBAC differs from MAC and DAC access management systems, it can easily apply these policies.

 ### Event-Driven Programming in Node.js

Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. Check any major framework or software out there and odds are you'll find evidence of it. In this article we'll go over how it works and how we can make the best use of it in our projects.
