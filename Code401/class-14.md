## Tree Data Structure

### What is a Tree Data Structure ?
A tree is a non linear data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a root value and sub trees of children with parent node, represented as set of linked nodes.

### Tree terms –
1- Root – Root is a special node in a tree. The entire tree is referenced through it. It does not have a parent.

2- Parent Node – Parent node is an immediate predecessor of a node.

3- Child Node – All immediate successors of a node are its children.

4- Siblings – Nodes with the same parent are called Siblings.

5- Leaf – Last node in the tree. There is no node after this node.

6- Edge – Edge is a connection between one node to another. It is a line between two nodes or a node and a leaf.

7- Path – Path is a number of successive edges from source node to destination node.

### Tree terms / properties –
1- Tree can be termed as a RECURSIVE data structure.

2- In a valid tree for N Nodes we have N-1 Edges/Links

3- Depth of Node – Depth of a node represents the number of edges from the tree’s root node to the node.

4- Height of Node – Height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path between that node & a leaf.

5- Height of Tree – Height of tree represents the height of its root node.
