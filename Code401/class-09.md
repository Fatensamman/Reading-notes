##  OAuth:

Open Authorization, or OAuth, is a technical standard that helps you to exchange data between providers without sharing your password. It's a commonly used standard for website and software developers, and you actually use OAuth-based services on a regular basis.

OAuth helps third-party providers to share your data without requiring you to share your password. And the more you give up your secret, and the more codes you give up, the more likely the passwords are to be stolen.

Tokens are used in the OAuth method. "Access keys" are what they're called. An access token allows one third-party source to have temporary access to a small quantity of your personal information held by another third-party source.
