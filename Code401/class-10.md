## Stacks and Queues

### Stacks:

** A stack is a linear data structure that works under the theory of "second in, first out." What exactly does that imply? Consider the following scenario: we have a list of facts. When we add anything to the chart, it is placed at the bottom. We delete anything from the end of the list as we remove it from the list. We add pieces of paper to the stack and delete pieces of paper from the top (we don't take from the bottom or middle). The key thing to note is that data is inserted and deleted at the same end of the data structure.



### Queues:

A queue is a data system that works under the concept of "first in, first out." Isn't that how it sounds? It looks like a stack, but the way material is stripped is different. Let's pretend we have a to-do plan. When we add anything to the page, it is stacked at the bottom. We would, however, delete the detail from the line rather than the end. It's as if you're in line for something (or queue hint hint if you are British). At the very end of the queue, people join. When they get to the front, people form a line.
