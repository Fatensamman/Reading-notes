##  Data Modeling

1- Advantages to Test Driven Development:
 - Better program design and higher code quality
 - High test coverage
 - Easier to refactor

 2- In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
 when a procedure should be called before a test and another method should be called after it

 3- What is one downside of Test Driven Development?
 slow process,Tests got to be maintained when requirements change.

 4- What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
 Class Inheritance: A class is like a blueprint — a description of the object to be created. Classes inherit from classes and create subclass relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies.

 5-Why REST (Representational state transfer)?
is an architectural style for establishing web-based specifications for computer systems, making it simpler for them to communicate with one another.

### Terms:
- functional programming : is a way to create applications by writing pure functions without the use of mutual state, mutable data, or side effects. The condition of an application flows by pure functions in functional programming, which is declarative rather than imperative.

- Object-oriented programming :is a programming paradigm for computers that organizes software design around data, rather than functions and logic. An object is a data field with its own collection of attributes and actions.

- Class: templates for creating objects.

- TDD: TDD is a software creation process in which software specifications are turned into test cases before the software is completely built, and all software development is tracked by comparing the software against all test cases several times.

- Jest: is a JavaScript testing system that ensures that every JavaScript codebase is valid.

- Continuous Integration (CI): is a programming practice that allows developers to commit code to a public repository on a daily basis. After that, an automatic construct verifies each check-in, helping teams to catch issues early.

- REST: is an architectural style for establishing web-based specifications for computer systems.
