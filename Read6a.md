## Java Script

- It's better to keep JavaScript in your own JavaScript code.JavaScript files (like HTML pages and pages) are text files. (Sheets of CSS style), but they have . Extension J s. 

- In HTML pages, the HTML element <'script' >' is used To notify the browser that the JavaScript file should be loaded .

- If you are viewing the page's source code in the browser, JavaScript didn't change the HTML file, 
The script fits with the web model. 
 
- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.

- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.

- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. 

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
