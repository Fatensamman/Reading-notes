## Introducing CSS

- CSS treats each HTML element to its own box inside X, and uses rules to display how it looks. 
- Selectors and declarations are composed of rules (that define the X elements for which the rule applies) (that indicate what these elements should look like). 

- You can aim your X rules on different elements with different types of selectors.
- Statement(s) consists of two parts: the properties X and the values of these properties of the element you want to modify. 
- The font family property, for example, sets the font preference and Arial is given as the preferred typeface by the arial value. 

- CSS rules are normally shown in a separate documents, X even though they can be shown on an HTML tab.

## Color

- Color not only gives life to the web, it also allows X to communicate mood and respond. 

- CSS colors can be specified in three ways: X RGB values, hex codings, and color names. 
- You will select the color you like through color pickers.
- X  It is essential that X between any text and color of the background is sufficient (otherwise people will not be able to read your content). 

- CSS3 added an additional value to signify opacity for RGB colors to X. It's named RGBA. 
- You can also designate colors for HSL values as CSS3, X for optional opacity. It's named HSLA.
